<h1>2022 (In Progress)</h1>
<p>January: </p>
<p>February: </p>
<p>March: This month has been about making sense of wavelets, optimality in
kernels, approximation theory in sparse signal processing, definitions of
continuity in sequences and series, introduction to probability, and random
matrix theory. Needless to say, I understand the material half as well as I
should. I'm using spring break to make some more sense of all of this in lieu
of the two talks at SINE and Kernel Club.</p>
